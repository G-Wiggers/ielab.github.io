## About this project

Valuable grains R&D output is currently locked away into project reports, communications and scientific publications. This textbased information is not easily discoverable and synthesised. Thus growers are not able to put into practice these valuable insights.

The purpose of this project is to develop a conversational agent - AgAsk - to provide personalised access to this valuable information and thus support better, data-driven growing decisions. The project takes a machine learning (ML) approach by training a question-answering system that elicits and understand growers information needs and preferences, providing contextualised access to insights in Ag RD&E.

AgAsk employs state-of-the-art ML technology to interpret natural language questions. GRDC resources are mined from textual information and converted into a knowledge graph capturing key agricultural concepts and relations (e.g. “protozoa” -effective_for--> “control of pest molluscs”). AgAsk uses this knowledge graph to formulate contextualised and interpretable answers to a grower’s question, e.g. “how to deal with slugs in Darling Downs wheat crop”.

AgAsk is designed to be deployed in the field, readily available across the wide growers sector. Growers are included from the beginning of this project in “grower-gatherings” – consultation workshops to collect real-world needs, through to user acceptance testing of the system.
