We are recruiting a fully funded PhD student position for a project titled "_Searching when the stakes are high: better health decisions from Dr Google_".

**Project Description**

This project aims to help people make better health decisions from search engines. 80% of Australians use Dr Google despite evidence showing that many often find incorrect and unreliable health information, which can increase the severity of their health condition, ultimately increasing cost of healthcare delivery.

This project expects to provide new understanding about why and how people fail to find useful health information. Expected outcomes of this project are new models and methods for evaluating high-stakes search and new search technologies to help people find and recognise high quality information to make better health decisions. This should provide significant benefits to Australian health consumers and the healthcare system. 

The successful applicant will enrol through the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering.
 
**Preferred educational background** 

Computer Science, Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning

*The successful candidate must commence by Research Quarter 1, 2020. You should apply at least 3 months prior to the research quarter commencement date. International applicants may need to apply much earlier for visa reasons.
