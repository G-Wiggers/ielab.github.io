I am a associate professor at the University of Queensland Information Technology and  Electrical Engineering School, and an ARC DECRA Fellow (2018-2020). I am the research leader of the ielab. My research interests span a number of topics:

* __Formal models of Information Retrieval__; in particular I am interested in
	- models of search, information seeking and interactions
	- semantic models of search
	- exploiting word embeddings in Information Retrieval
	- evaluation of Information Retrieval (including task-based evaluation)
* __Medical/Health Information Retrieval and Data Science__; in particular I am interested in
	- retrieval models & strategies for consumers searching the web for health advise
	- retrieval models & strategies for cohort identification for clinical trials from electronic medical records
	- retrieval models & strategies for clinical decision support and evidence-based medicine
	- models, approaches and strategies for automating systematic reviews, in particular with respect to the search phase
	- health search evaluation

If you are a UQ student, or a prospective one, and you are interested to work with me as part of your studies, you can find ideas for research projects for PhD and other research degrees [here](http://ielab.io/student-projects). I also welcome international higher education students wanting to do a research visit and collaborating on ideas within my research interests.
