My research focuses 
on efficient and effective representations for large-scale search engines, 
including indexing, compression, and retrieval. I am also interested in 
understanding how to measure improvements in the end-to-end search pipeline, 
including system-oriented effectiveness measurements and user behaviour analysis.
I have a broad interest in empirical experimentation, operating systems, 
data structures, and algorithms. Please see my personal site for more details.
