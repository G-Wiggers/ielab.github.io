## Abstract

â€”RNA family classification is one of the necessary tasks needed to characterize
sequenced genomes. RNA families are defined by member sequences which perform the
same function in different species. Such functions have a strong relationship with RNA
secondary structures but not the primary sequence. Thus RNA sequences alone are not
sufficient to classify RNA families. Here, we focus on computational RNA family
classification by exploring primary sequences with RNA secondary structures as the
selected feature to classify the RNA family using the method of conditional random
fields (CRFs). This model treats RNA classification as a sequence labeling problem.
Our CRFs models can classify the RNA families of the test RNA data sets with optimal
F-score prediction between 98.77% - 99.32% for different RNA families.
