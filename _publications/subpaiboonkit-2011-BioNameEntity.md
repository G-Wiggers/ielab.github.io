## Abstract

â€”Biomedical named entity recognition (NER) is an important technique for
biological information extraction. Here, we have proposed a model using
machine learning where biological terms are recognized using second-order
conditional random fields (CRFs). From our experiments with the JNLPBA
2004 dataset, the CRFs labeling model returns an F-score prediction value of
almost 99%.
