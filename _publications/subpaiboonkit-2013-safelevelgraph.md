## Abstract

â€”In the class imbalance problem, most existent
classifiers which are designed by the distribution of balance
datasets fail to recognize minority classes since a large number of
negative instances can dominate a few positive instances.
Borderline-SMOTE and Safe-Level-SMOTE are over-sampling
techniques which are applied to handle this situation by
generating synthetic instances in different regions. The former
operates on the border of a minority class while the latter works
inside the class far from the border. Unfortunately, a data miner
is unable to conveniently justify a suitable SMOTE for each
dataset. In this paper, a safe level graph is proposed as a
guideline tool for selecting an appropriate SMOTE and describes
the characteristic of a minority class in an imbalance dataset.
Relying on advice of a safe level graph, the experimental success
rate is shown to reach 73% when an F-measure is used as the
performance measure and 78% for satisfactory AUCs.
