We present our participating Docker image in the SIGIR  Open-Source IR Replicability Challenge 2019. Our participation includes an Elasticsearch-based Docker image conforming to the specifications laid out by the challenge, a collection parser, and a topic parser. Our Docker image is capable of indexing and searching several commonly used Information Retrieval test collections including robust04 (Trec 2004 Robust Track Topics -- disks 4/5), core17 (TREC New York Times Annotated Corpus), and core18 (TREC Washington Post Corpus). The Docker image and associated tools we present in this paper provide a solid foundation for replicable Information Retrieval experiments using Elasticsearch.
