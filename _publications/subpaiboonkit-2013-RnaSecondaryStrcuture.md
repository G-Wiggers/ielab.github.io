## Abstract

—Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have important biological functions in
living cells dependent on their conserved secondary structures. Here, we focus
on computational RNA secondary structure prediction by exploring primary
sequences and complementary base pair interactions using the Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) model, which treats RNA prediction as a sequence
labelling problem. Proposing suitable feature extraction from known RNA
secondary structures, we developed a feature extraction based on natural
RNA’s loop and stem characteristics. Our CRFs models can predict the
secondary structures of the test RNAs with optimal F-score prediction between
56.61 and 98.20% for different RNA families.
