Abstract
**Purpose:** A conceptual model describes important factors within a system and how they relate to one another. They are important because they help to identify system changes that can yield the greatest improvement. Within Information Retrieval (IR), most research is directed towards multi-document retrieval and a multi-interaction IR (miIR) user scenario.  There are few, if any, IR conceptual models supporting minimal or single-interaction IR (siIR) user scenarios, however the need for siIR systems is growing rapidly.  This paper takes the first steps towards constructing a task-oriented conceptual model and experimental framework to support siIR research.\\

**Approach:** A first principles approach is employed to develop a task-oriented conceptual model, called Bridging Information Retrieval (BIR). This model is contrasted with the concept of Relevance, a central factor within IR research.\\

**Findings:** BIR introduces the central concept of Bridging Information (BI) as the objective of IR systems. BI is the additional information a user requires to complete a task, beyond their innate knowledge. The relationship between BI and relevance is determined. \\

**Research Limitations:** The theoretical basis of BIR is derived axiomatically, however the resulting system evaluation model is speculative.\\

**Practical Implications:** The proposed operational framework offers researchers a systematic approach to designing and evaluating siIR systems.\\

**Originality:** This work contributes a novel task-oriented IR conceptual model and evaluation framework, both centred around the concept of BI for siIR. It also contributes a novel search task classification method.\\
