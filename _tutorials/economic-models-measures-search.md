Economics provides an intuitive and natural way to formally represent the costs and benefits of interacting with applications, interfaces and devices. By using economic models it is possible to reason about interaction, make predictions about how changes to the system will affect performance and behavior, and measure the performance of people's interactions with the system.  In this course, we will first provide an overview of relevant economic theories e.g., information foraging theory and the microeconomics of search. This will be then followed by a session showing how economics can be used to model interaction with search systems to generate hypotheses about behaviour and performance which can be used to inform design and guide experimentation. The third session will focus on how economics has been used to underpin the measurement of information retrieval systems and applications using the CWL framework (which reports the expected utility, expected total utility, expected total cost, etc.) - and how  different models of user interaction lead to different metrics. We then will show how information foraging theory can be used to measure the performance of an information retrieval system - connecting the theory of how people search with how we measure it. The final session of the day will be spent building economic models and measures of search. Here sample problems will be provided to challenge participants, or participants can bring their own.
