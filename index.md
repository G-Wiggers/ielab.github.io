# The Information Engineering Lab

We a collaborative group of researchers working in the the area of information engineering. Much of this research is specifically on the areas of [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval); i.e., search.

## Projects

ielab works on a diversity of projects. Some examples include:

* Health Search
* Formal IR models

The current projects that ielab is working on including links to code repositories, live demos, and publications can be found on the [projects page](/projects). For advertised **student projects** (including PhD, masters, and undergraduate) please visit the [student projects page](/student-projects).
