# The Information Engineering Lab

The ielab is a collaborative group of researchers working in the area of information engineering. Much of this research is specifically on the areas of [information retrieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval), i.e. search, and health informatics.

## Projects

ielab works on a diversity of projects. Research strenghts include:

* **Formal models of Information Retrieval:** retrieval models, learning to rank, user models, evaluation of information retrieval systems. 
* **Health Search:** models, systems, evaluation for tasks in consumer health search, clinical decision support, precision medicine, search for systematic review compilation, cohort selection for clinical trials.
* **Domain-specific search:** case law retrieval.

The **current projects** that ielab is working on including links to code repositories, live demos, and publications can be found on the [projects page](/projects). 

For advertised **student projects** (including PhD, masters, and undergraduate) please visit the [student projects page](/student-projects). 

To view a list of the group **publications**, please visit the [publications page](/publications).

## People

ielab was started as a group of Information Retrieval researchers at the [Queensland Univeristy of Technology (QUT)](http://www.qut.edu.au) in Brisbane, Australia. However, the group has expanded to include researchers from [CSIRO](http://csiro.au), [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/), [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/), [Qatar Computing Research Institute](http://www.qcri.com) and more. From October 1, 2018, the core of the ielab research group will be hosted at the [University of Queensland (UQ)](http://www.uq.edu.au), among the world's top-50 universities.
